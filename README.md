# zero-hello-svelte5

This is a Svelte local-first app that uses:

- [Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/docs/introduction)
- [@stolinski/zero-svelte](https://github.com/stolinski/zero-svelte)

It is a port of the React version of [hello-zero](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero)

This is a work in progress. I am looking for contributors to help get this project working.

Once the project is working, Svelte developers interested in how to use Zero with Svelte can use this project as a starting point.
